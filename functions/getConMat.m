%This function calculates the connectivity matrix C and the correclation
% % matrix corr
% according to Wong et al, 1993 
% "The correlation index corrij between two spike trains A and B is defined as
% the factor by which the firing rate of channel A increases over its mean
% value if measured within a fixed window (default here 0.1 s) of spikes
% from neuron B (Wong et al., 1993)."  
%
% 1) calculation of connectivity matrix C:
% detection of spikes from electrode B that fall inside a synchronicity window around a
% particular spike from electrode A. The number of spike pairs on each
% electrode a summed up resulting in a square matrix C with the size
% nbElectrode x nbELectrode
% 
% 2) correlation indices are determined from C according to:
%    corr= C*T/(nbSpikes)*dT
%    nbSPikes is a square matrix from same size as C containing the product
%    of number of spikes of the corresponding pairs.
