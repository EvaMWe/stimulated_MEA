% function to dilate a binary vector (for example containing time stamps of
% a channel;
% vec: is the vector that has to be dilated
% len: is the lenght of the linear structuring element; since this function
% operates in 1-D also len hat just one dimension
% J is replaced from the first element on:
% first element J1 is the max within the structuring element including
% vec_1:vec_len; the second J2 is the max within vec_2:vec_len+1...and so
% on;

function J = dil_2D(TS, len)

J_temp =zeros(n_row + len,n_col);
TS_temp = zeros( n_row + len,n_col);
